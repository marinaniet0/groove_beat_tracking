## MIR Project - Beat and downbeat tracking over the Groove MIDI Dataset
This was developed as a class project within the SMC Master program at UPF. It is based on the work done in https://github.com/chuang76/symbolic-beat-tracking, so a great deal of code and logic is taken from it.

PS.: The accuracy of the models at the moment is quite poor, probably due to errors in training.
